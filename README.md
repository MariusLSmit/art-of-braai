# Art of braai

Art of braai is a website that not only teaches you, but also inspires you to make a lovely and tradional boerewors roll. This is basically a South African "Hot dog" which consists of a beef sausage, bread roll and relish and all made the traditional way. "Braai" is also the South African term for barbeque and this would be the traditional way to cook the sausage. View the live site here "Insert site link here".

## Bugs

- Page 2 - Form element had to be changed to figure as it was not the right scemantic element used and the form error was caused by not adding the same value to the id and both were simple fixes.

- Page 3 - There was a frameborder issue  and was a quick fix by removing it from the html code and adding the same to css. 
         - With the video container issue I was not using the element and switched it to a figure to resolve the issue.
