# Art of braai

![Website mockup](/assets/img/mockup%20screenshot.png)

Art of braai is a website that not only teaches you, but also inspires you to make a lovely and tradional boerewors roll. This is basically a South African "Hot dog" which consists of a beef sausage, bread roll and relish and all made the traditional way. "Braai" is also the South African term for barbeque and this would be the traditional way to cook the sausage. View the live site here "Insert site link here".

<br>

* CSS

- This was done with [(jigsaw) offical validator](/assets/img/Screenshot-w3sCss.png)
<br>
      - No errors were returned

### Bugs

- Page 2 - Form element had to be changed to figure as it was not the right scemantic element used and the form error was caused by not adding the same value to the id and both were simple fixes.

- Page 3 - There was a frameborder issue  and was a quick fix by removing it from the html code and adding the same to css. 
         - With the video container issue I was not using the element and switched it to a figure to resolve the issue.

* Responsiveness has been tested for 3 screen types on chrome devtools.

+ Mobile screens - 600px and down
+ Tablets - 600px and up 
+ Desktop and larger screens - 992px and up

Page 3 ![Page 3](/assets/img/page3-lighthouse.png)

### Unfixed Bugs

* When doing mobile testing the Navbar seems to unsort itself into the wrong direction and the social links darken due to screen sizing.

## UX/UI

### Site goal

The goal of Art of braai is to teach people that are not native to South Africa that there is more than just having a barbeque. The goal is to turn a barbeque into a braai which is the native word for it and the reason why a boerewors roll is chosen which is like a hotdog, is because it is probably the easiest way to make a nice meal but also enjoy the moment with the people surrounding you and that is the true South African way.

### Design choices

I chose a fire background because a flame has so many different colours so it game me a nice colour pallet that I could use around the rest of the website. I also feel that a flame is never the same and always attracts people no matter where it is and I hope this does the same for the site.

## Deployment

### Gitpod

This site was made using gitpod and then deployed to Github pages.

* On gitpod the following commands were used:

+ Git add .  -  to add file to staging area.
+ Git commit -m "message"  -  This command was used to commit changes to the local repository. 
+ Git push  -  This command was used to push commited content to github and was the final step.

### Deployment to Github pages with steps

- Deployment to GitHub pages was done with the following steps:
+ When in the GitHub repository, click on to the Settings tab
+ The page will refresh, then on the menu to the left select 'Pages'
+ Then from the source section drop-down menu, select the Branch and main
+ Click the 'Save' button
+ When this is done a live link will be displayed and a green banner will be displayed.
